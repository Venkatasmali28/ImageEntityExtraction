# ImageEntityExtraction
This document outlines the approach taken for extracting entity values from images in a machine learning challenge. The primary tool employed was PyTesseract, an optical character recognition (OCR) library. The goal was to accurately extract relevant information, such as weight, volume, voltage, wattage, and dimensions, from product images.
